<h1 align='left'>Hello fellow blob of carbon! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <a href="http://rinkiyakedad.github.io/">Arsh Sharma</a></h1></br>

I get excited about all (*well almost all*) things tech! I love creating stuff and contributing to open source.

Particularly interested in distributed systems and the development of applications in the cloud-native ecosystem. I also like talking about my experiences and things I learn in my [blogs](http://rinkiyakedad.github.io/tags) and at conferences!

If you'd like to see what all I've worked on, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/RinkiyaKeDad) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arsh4/). If you want to drop a message, you'll find ways to reach me on my [website](http://rinkiyakedad.github.io/) :)
