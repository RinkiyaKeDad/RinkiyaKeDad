<h1 align='left'>Hello fellow blob of carbon! ðŸ‘‹, I'm <a href="http://rinkiyakedad.github.io/">Arsh Sharma</a></h1></br>

I'm enthusiastic about all (*well almost all*) things tech! I particularly love open source and distributed systems. 

I enjoy learning new things and writing about them in my [blogs](http://rinkiyakedad.github.io/tags). If you'd like to see what all I've worked on, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/RinkiyaKeDad) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arsh4/). If you're looking to connect you'll find ways to reach me on [my webiste](http://rinkiyakedad.github.io/) :)

Fun Fact: I may not know how to invert a binary tree in O(N) but I can Google how to do that in O(1) :P
