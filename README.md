<h1 align='left'>Hello fellow blob of carbon! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <a href="http://rinkiyakedad.github.io/">Arsh Sharma</a></h1></br>

I get excited about all (*well almost all*) things tech! I love creating stuff and contributing to open source.

Particularly interested in distributed systems and building infrastructure tools. I also like talking about my experiences and things I learn in my [blogs](http://rinkiyakedad.github.io/tags) and at conferences!
