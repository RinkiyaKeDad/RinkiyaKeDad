<h1 align='left'>Hey there! 👋 I'm <a href="https://arshsharma.com/">Arsh</a></h1></br>

Hey there! My name is Arsh. Across the internet, you’ll also find me as @RinkiyaKeDad in many places. 

With a diverse background in engineering roles, open source, and a knack for simplifying complex technical concepts, I bring a unique perspective to the table. Often, I find myself being the “engineer” on non-engineering teams. What does that mean?
